# SIH-2023
## This project, developed as part of Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2023, aims to create a robust web-based solution to manage and recycle e-waste efficiently. Our system provides users with tools to locate nearby e-waste collection facilities, gain eco-awareness, and earn incentives for sustainable actions.
